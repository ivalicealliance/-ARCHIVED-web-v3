[1:04:47 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> rikku
[1:04:49 AM] -- Joined channel: Op FFC-Rikku --
[1:04:52 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> well thnk you
[1:05:05 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> its nice to know that ffc has someone in upper leadership that knows something about something
[1:05:15 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> and that you actually will hear me out
[1:05:20 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> There's always a brain behind a tongue.
[1:05:38 AM] -- IA-Reno@USEast [47ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (34 wins).
[1:05:52 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> So, then.
[1:05:54 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> agreed
[1:05:56 AM] -- IA-Laguna@USEast [32ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (9 wins).
[1:05:58 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Just for clarification
[1:06:05 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Reno is Zanarkand, Sephiroth is Kadaj and Laguna is..?
[1:06:10 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> I was not aware Laguna would be joining at all, actually.
[1:06:12 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> alexander
[1:06:14 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Sephiroth is NOT Kadaj
[1:06:16 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> remember me? =P
[1:06:18 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> i wasnt either
[1:06:19 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> I do.
[1:06:23 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> ;)
[1:06:33 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Okay, then Sephiroth is not affiliated in FFC?
[1:06:38 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> no
[1:06:41 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> just me and reno
[1:06:41 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> do you mean me or FFC-Sephiroth
[1:06:45 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> You.
[1:06:49 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> In any case.
[1:06:51 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I have not been affiliated with FFC
[1:06:54 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I'm sorry :(
[1:06:55 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> let him them talk alex
[1:07:01 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Alexander, it's good to see you again, though in unfortunate circumstances.
[1:07:13 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Sephiroth, your affiliation is not one that is required, nor missed. No offense.
[1:07:18 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I know
[1:07:19 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> now that was unexpected.. of her
[1:07:24 AM] <To your friends> no kidding
[1:07:40 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> So, why have you come to me tonight, or rather, this morning?
[1:07:59 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Well, both you and I know that both our clans talk about each other
[1:08:18 AM] <From FFC-Bahamut@USEast> but we dont talk bad about them, thats what i told her, a nd its semi true
[1:08:24 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Today IA-Squall without asking even joined your channel and reported some actions of your clan to us
[1:08:40 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> oh i see
[1:08:44 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I realised at that point that there is a great deal of anger between FFC and our clan
[1:09:12 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I wanted to communicate, and I have tried as well through our site today that we do not intend to do anything that causes problems for FFC
[1:09:49 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> lol ya.. he always was
[1:10:02 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> =O nice
[1:10:23 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> My turn?
[1:10:26 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> lol
[1:10:28 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> if you wish
[1:11:01 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> The topic of IA is one that comes across only when forced to. In most cases, we've more important topics and situations that come across.
[1:11:03 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> However.
[1:11:38 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> i do to so im there
[1:11:42 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> If there ever were a thorn to the side of a beast, it would be IA in that of our leadership. Whilst your knowledge in IA's birth and history should be one that is broad thanks to your coleadership
[1:11:56 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> I somehow doubt that even you two coleaders have full understanding as to what happened to have made IA such a large pest in our eyes in the first place.
[1:12:09 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I know that we do not
[1:12:23 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> hmm.....
[1:12:24 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> You speak of peaceful coexistence, yet as I learned from JJ, your leader, Balthier is out in vacation and I can not presume that he has given authority and approval of this action.
[1:13:02 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I understand that you cannot presume such, If you wish I can inform him of this conversation when he returns and have him contact you to confirm my actions
[1:13:07 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> In fact, I would suggest the first way to reprimand the harm your leader has made to us is in the way of a formal and public apology made to our two leaders, Yuffie and Kefka from him.
[1:13:27 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Apology?
[1:13:39 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> FUCK THAT!!!!!!!!!!
[1:13:45 AM] <To your friends> what did we do?
[1:13:47 AM] <To your friends> :S
[1:13:55 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> APOLOGY MY ASS
[1:13:56 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Tell me
[1:13:59 AM] <From FFC-Bahamut@USEast> she said that Balthier insulted them
[1:14:07 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> rofl me dunno man
[1:14:07 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> How does your clan handle disobedience to leadership from a lower ranked recruit?
[1:14:14 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> he did i was there when it happen
[1:14:23 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> This is where our clan gets... unique
[1:14:31 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Entertain me.
[1:14:33 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> good word lol
[1:14:36 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> gosu
[1:14:41 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> We almost have no distinguishment between leadership and the lower ranks
[1:14:58 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> We allow leaders to maintain the clan in terms of the site, adding members, etc
[1:15:15 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> but the leaders are not resembled as mighty icons of authority
[1:15:20 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> hld on zack
[1:15:32 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> more or less we would be considered powerful friends
[1:15:41 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> so, in answer to your question
[1:15:42 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> yeah like Seph is like total newb at SC *cough*
[1:15:44 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast>  j/k
[1:16:14 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> If someone were to disobey, they would have to go through a discussion with our leaders, and depending on the severity, they could be banned
[1:16:36 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> lol aled
[1:16:37 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> alex
[1:16:40 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> :P
[1:16:42 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> We actually have not had the need to do such a thing yet, due to the way that we generally try to recruit
[1:17:13 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> there is a lack of disobedience because
[1:17:18 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> There isn't much in our clan that a member could disobey though
[1:17:24 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> we do not do what we are told
[1:17:29 AM] <FFC-Bahamut@USEast> but we do what we are asked
[1:17:31 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Let's say, hypothetically, that a normal member, by which I mean non-leader, treats an actual leader-responsible member in disrespect by ignoring them, and then not responding to them when asked.
[1:18:05 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Well, that I would consider being afk
[1:18:20 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Then you did not read correctly. I meant ignore. Not stop typing all out.
[1:18:24 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Acknowleding others, but not the leader.
[1:18:28 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> otherwise it may not be necessary to pursue the conversaition unless correctly justified
[1:18:35 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> ya really
[1:18:38 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I see...
[1:18:57 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> ya really tell me about it
[1:19:10 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Unfortunately I do not know what I would do in that situation, in our clan we don't really have a situation demanding enough to do anything abou tit
[1:19:15 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> about it*
[1:19:27 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> lol alex
[1:19:29 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> xP
[1:19:48 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> As I said before, we do not ahve symbols of authority, therefore we are not regulated BY our authority
[1:20:01 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> if in your clan someone were to backtalk you, you would be forced to take action
[1:20:04 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> right?
[1:20:11 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Possibly by banning or kicking
[1:20:34 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> If you wish to simplify the means, yes.
[1:20:36 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I can't see much of a situation where that would happen in ours because of our lesser power
[1:20:50 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Also, if you speak of passive leadership, then why even consider yourself a coleader? Why have an ops? Why have an ops channel at all?
[1:21:05 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Does it not seem quite odd that you would have that in supply?
[1:21:10 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> who's gonna run the bitch?
[1:21:12 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> we have an ops channel so we can all hang out with each other
[1:21:31 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> You can do that virtually anywhere. And I mean anywhere.
[1:21:40 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> and we have bots to keep us informed, as well as to allow banning of members who come in or bots that join to spam
[1:21:59 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> if we can do it virtually anywhere, then IA is as good a place as any
[1:22:19 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Balthier and myself decided on the name Ivalice Alliance back when we made the clan
[1:22:35 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> it was simply because it had ties to Final Fantasy, which is what we want the clan to be based around
[1:22:41 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> well dang im sorry that we dont run things like ....w/e
[1:22:58 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> dont know
[1:23:07 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> We did not create the clan with the intent to compete with FFC, it was intended to be the Alternative
[1:23:12 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> man balthier is missin out
[1:23:35 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> to give Final Fantasy members a second chance if they were banned from your clan, or if we recruited them from scratch
[1:23:35 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> ya
[1:24:04 AM] <To your friends> Reno are you wanting to add anything? if you want to I'll intro you
[1:24:22 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I assume you would like to reply at this point
[1:24:32 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> i really dont have anything to add... i do bu ti think i should keep it to myself
[1:24:46 AM] <To your friends> yea, keep it to urself then
[1:24:50 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> ya
[1:25:36 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> well when i can... i just want to say hey
[1:25:37 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> It is unfortunate that Balthier cannot be here to speak for himself, He made me the coleader because I could be here when he would not be available.
[1:26:01 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Well, I would request a conference with him whenever possible. Just so I can see what his agenda is.
[1:26:02 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I am sure you can understand considering FFC-Reno is in the military as well and is sometimes gone for days at a time as well
[1:26:25 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Reno is the same rank as I. I would not understand, in all honesty.
[1:26:25 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I will save this conversation and ask that he contact you when he's back.  April 10th Reno?
[1:26:33 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> oh yes
[1:26:40 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> he is back April 10th
[1:27:32 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I understand that FFC-Reno is very dedicated in your clan, that actually was not what I was trying to explain.  Just that the military duties caused him to not be available at this time
[1:27:43 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Now, I may be the wrong person to talk to at all here. While I have intimate knowledge of the clan's system and how it works, as well as detail in every leadership member, I do not speak for it.
[1:27:52 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Yes, I understand that much.
[1:28:00 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I understand that too
[1:28:15 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> omg 10 pages of that shit
[1:28:18 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Anyways, I feel I am wasting your time, do you want me to leave?
[1:29:15 AM] <To IA-Laguna@USEast> are you afk laguna?
[1:29:21 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> took screens
[1:29:24 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> lol
[1:29:34 AM] <To IA-Laguna@USEast> no need, i've got my bot running
[1:29:44 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> oh fuck you lol
[1:29:49 AM] <To IA-Laguna@USEast> logging the conversations, srry
[1:29:49 AM] <From IA-Laguna@USEast> <3
[1:30:00 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> No, I've not much else on at the moment.
[1:30:03 AM] <To your friends> ready to leave?
[1:30:12 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> If you have other business to attend to, you can leave.
[1:30:16 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> oh Rikku... you Z is still not better than mine =P
[1:30:16 AM] <From IA-Reno@USEast> thats fine
[1:30:17 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> hhaha
[1:30:20 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> ;)
[1:30:22 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> Lies and heresy!
[1:30:24 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> =P
[1:30:26 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> alex....
[1:30:38 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Ok, well, enjoy your morning, and we won't impersonate FFC members again under IA's knowledge
[1:30:40 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> I am The Zerg, if you've so quickly forgotten.
[1:30:44 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> oh ok
[1:30:59 AM] <IA-Laguna@USEast> I think someone on west took "TheZerg" as his name
[1:31:07 AM] <FFC-Rikku@USEast> So long you uphold that word, Sephiroth, you can expect the same from FFC.
[1:31:20 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> Understood
[1:31:24 AM] <IA-Reno@USEast> We, thank you on that rikku
[1:31:29 AM] <IA-Sephiroth> I'm going back to channel Reno
