(10:33:59 PM) FFCGolbez: you two need to work out your tension
(10:34:04 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, I feel I've done nothing wrong to be treated the way she is treating me.

(10:34:29 PM) yuffear: You've ignored me on multiple occasions, and disrupted the entire being of the clan!
(10:34:30 PM) FFCGolbez: I know you worked hard on your avatars
(10:34:39 PM) FFCGolbez: but unless asked,dont make em.
(10:34:45 PM) FFCGolbez: yeah,you did ignore here
(10:34:48 PM) FFCGolbez: her*
(10:34:57 PM) yuffear: Disrespectful
(10:35:03 PM) FFCGolbez: she tried hard to work shit out,which I didn't know
(10:35:04 PM) yuffear: I don't care how long of a week you've had
(10:35:06 PM) FF4Cecil: Why can't I make avatars?
(10:35:08 PM) FFCGolbez: and I wish I knew
(10:35:13 PM) FFCGolbez: I can,Cecil
(10:35:16 PM) yuffear: Because Cecil
(10:35:17 PM) FFCGolbez: Have you're on topic.
(10:35:20 PM) FFCGolbez: I'll pin it
(10:35:26 PM) yuffear: Did you realize who was making Avatars before you?
(10:35:27 PM) FFCGolbez: "Cecil's Avatars"
(10:35:50 PM) FFCGolbez: If someone asks you, you can make it
(10:35:55 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, most people in the clan didn't really have their own avatars, so I took it upon myself to make one for everyone.
(10:35:58 PM) FFCGolbez: Yuffie's made some wickekd ass avatars
(10:36:08 PM) FFCGolbez: I still use her latest one of Golbez as MSN Display Pic
(10:36:21 PM) FFCGolbez: it's cool Cecil
(10:36:24 PM) FFCGolbez: That you do that
(10:36:30 PM) FFCGolbez: without thinking or asking
(10:36:37 PM) FFCGolbez: but the thing is
(10:36:52 PM) FFCGolbez: people here,we do shit for the clan, because we want to
(10:37:03 PM) FFCGolbez: I don't have to make comics, or recruit, or do anything
(10:37:08 PM) FFCGolbez: We do shit ebcause we want to
(10:37:13 PM) FFCGolbez: not because we are of that rank
(10:37:25 PM) FFCGolbez: If you want a good rank man
(10:37:31 PM) FFCGolbez: you have to realize that
(10:37:34 PM) FF4Cecil: I never did anything for rank man.
(10:37:37 PM) FFCGolbez: IU mean that sunday, I was confused
(10:37:42 PM) FFCGolbez: by so many members
(10:37:52 PM) FFCGolbez: I know,Cecil
(10:38:01 PM) FFCGolbez: People really appreciate your work
(10:38:12 PM) FFCGolbez: You do a great job brother
(10:38:32 PM) FFCGolbez: but just try to chill out
(10:38:47 PM) FF4Cecil: But I am chilled out?
(10:38:50 PM) yuffear: No your not
(10:38:55 PM) FF4Cecil: I never blow up on any body.
(10:38:55 PM) yuffear: Your talking to every member
(10:39:02 PM) yuffear: And spreading shit around
(10:39:08 PM) yuffear: What the hell do you hope to accomplish?
(10:39:10 PM) FFCGolbez: You and Yuffie need to work out your tension
(10:39:17 PM) yuffear: Ok
(10:39:19 PM) FF4Cecil: I'm talking to my friends, about how I've been treated unfairly.
(10:39:24 PM) yuffear: Just let me talk for a minute.
(10:39:27 PM) yuffear: Cecil
(10:39:27 PM) FF4Cecil: I never broke any rules in the clan.
(10:39:40 PM) FFCGolbez: I know, Cecil.
(10:39:43 PM) FF4Cecil: But you treat me like I've broken every rule...
(10:39:53 PM) yuffear: Stop acting like you've been beaten
(10:39:57 PM) yuffear: Your such a wuss
(10:40:00 PM) yuffear: Seriously
(10:40:02 PM) yuffear: What is this crap?
(10:40:04 PM) FFCGolbez: But we've been around for a LONG time. And Yuffie has been a co-leader the whole time,and made all the right decisions.
(10:40:10 PM) yuffear: Why are you acted like you've done nothing wrong?
(10:40:14 PM) FF4Cecil: Can you be respectful Yuffie?
(10:40:19 PM) yuffear: Yeah I can be
(10:40:23 PM) yuffear: Not towards idiots
(10:40:23 PM) FF4Cecil: I really don't appreciate the name calling.
(10:40:26 PM) yuffear: Fuck you
(10:40:30 PM) yuffear: I'll name call all I want
(10:40:41 PM) yuffear: Don't tell me what to do
(10:40:52 PM) yuffear: Anyway
(10:40:58 PM) yuffear: You completely interrupted me
(10:41:01 PM) yuffear: I wasn't finished talking
(10:41:11 PM) FFCGolbez: I finally understand. The people of FFC are here for a common purpose. Fun, Gaming, Unity. Some people ( mainly some wc3 people ) are ignorant to that, so we ban.
(10:41:38 PM) FFCGolbez: Cecil man
(10:41:41 PM) yuffear: Golb
(10:41:41 PM) FFCGolbez: just chill
(10:41:46 PM) yuffear: Hold on a sec
(10:41:52 PM) yuffear: I gotta talk
(10:41:59 PM) FFCGolbez: I know
(10:42:04 PM) FF4Cecil: I am chill. I'm not calling anyone names here.
(10:42:10 PM) yuffear: Stfu
(10:42:13 PM) yuffear: Kid
(10:42:24 PM) yuffear: Stop acting like your so richious
(10:42:35 PM) FFCGolbez: Dude just listen to what she has to say and think about it. Yuffie is a very smart girl.
(10:42:43 PM) yuffear: richeous*
(10:42:47 PM) yuffear: Anyway
(10:43:06 PM) yuffear: You didn't say a god damn thing to me
(10:43:12 PM) yuffear: Instead you hid behind your wall
(10:43:18 PM) yuffear: And talked shit about me to all your friends
(10:43:31 PM) yuffear: Then you waited for golb to come on
(10:43:36 PM) yuffear: And then you pissed him off
(10:43:44 PM) yuffear: And you failed to mention that I was trying to fix things the whole time
(10:43:50 PM) yuffear: Which could of avoided all of the riot
(10:43:57 PM) yuffear: You started a big thing man, its not cool at all
(10:44:12 PM) yuffear: You disrespected me more then any member in this clan
(10:44:18 PM) yuffear: And you say you've done nothing wrong
(10:44:22 PM) yuffear: You broke the most important rule
(10:44:27 PM) yuffear: Sure I swear and shit
(10:44:29 PM) yuffear: Who the fuck cares
(10:44:32 PM) yuffear: I've earned the right to
(10:44:35 PM) yuffear: After all my hard ass work
(10:44:48 PM) yuffear: I respected you by trying to fix things
(10:44:57 PM) yuffear: And you didn't do shit back for me
(10:45:05 PM) yuffear: And just like today
(10:45:07 PM) yuffear: You ignored me
(10:45:14 PM) yuffear: And then when I ban you
(10:45:17 PM) yuffear: THATS When you can talk to me
(10:45:20 PM) FFCGolbez: he's reading, no worries.
(10:45:49 PM) yuffear: So yeah.
(10:46:03 PM) yuffear: FFC Avatars = Official = Me = Not you
(10:46:13 PM) yuffear: And the reason why I'm pissed about that
(10:46:17 PM) yuffear: Is because in many occasions
(10:46:23 PM) yuffear: You made avatars after I made them for people
(10:46:25 PM) yuffear: So its a slap in my face
(10:46:28 PM) yuffear: For the work I've done
(10:46:33 PM) yuffear: So I returned the favor.
(10:46:39 PM) yuffear: And outdid your ass
(10:46:54 PM) yuffear: Alright, I'm done.
(10:48:24 PM) FF4Cecil: May I speak now?
(10:48:37 PM) yuffear: I said I was done
(10:48:37 PM) FFCGolbez: Ya
(10:49:43 PM) FF4Cecil: I was gone most of the day when you were trying to talk me from the first time you banned me. When I did see the messages, I thought it was best not to talk to you because it would probably have made things worse for me.
(10:50:03 PM) yuffear: Thats no excuse
(10:50:04 PM) FF4Cecil: I feel everytime I try to talk to you, you don't listen to me, or you get extremely offended.
(10:50:12 PM) yuffear: Cecil
(10:50:18 PM) yuffear: If I'm offering to fix things
(10:50:21 PM) yuffear: Why the hell would you refuse it?
(10:50:23 PM) FFCGolbez: eh,when it comes to being bannedmyou should always talk to that person.
(10:50:23 PM) yuffear: And ignore me
(10:50:31 PM) FFCGolbez: We had aloooong talk between leaders.
(10:50:38 PM) FFCGolbez: Things will always be discussed now.
(10:50:45 PM) FFCGolbez: between member and leader,leader and leader
(10:51:30 PM) FF4Cecil: Every time I've approached you, I've been kind. I don't understand why you don't show me the same respect when you would like to speak with me.
(10:51:39 PM) yuffear: I've always shown you respect
(10:51:48 PM) yuffear: In fact I was giving you a badge the time you first disrespected me
(10:51:59 PM) yuffear: After that, I've shown you no respect because of the way you treated me
(10:52:08 PM) yuffear: Here cecil is a loyalty badge! Thanks for the awesome site!
(10:52:15 PM) yuffear: "why does it matter if your not gunna use it?"
(10:52:22 PM) yuffear: What the fuck is up your ass?
(10:52:31 PM) yuffear: Who told you that you couldn't use it?
(10:52:32 PM) yuffear: No one
(10:52:43 PM) yuffear: In fact after that I told you we wanted to use it just not for news
(10:52:51 PM) yuffear: And you wanted a "private" conversation with all the leaders
(10:52:55 PM) yuffear: as if my word wasn't enough
(10:53:01 PM) yuffear: Even though I already had it with frank
(10:53:08 PM) yuffear: which frank didn't even wanna use it in the first place
(10:53:10 PM) yuffear: But I said
(10:53:16 PM) yuffear: No Cecil did a lot of work, lets use it
(10:53:21 PM) yuffear: But I regret that
(10:53:24 PM) yuffear: I used to respect you
(10:53:29 PM) yuffear: Until you showed me a lot of bullshit
(10:53:35 PM) yuffear: your stubborn personality
(10:54:01 PM) FF4Cecil: Can I speak again? I wasn't really done earlier...
(10:54:10 PM) yuffear: I can talk whenver I want
(10:54:19 PM) yuffear: Your the one whose supposed to apologize.
(10:54:27 PM) yuffear: It doesn't really seem clear in your statements
(10:54:31 PM) yuffear: Concidering your only talking about yourself
(10:55:51 PM) yuffear: Regardless
(10:55:55 PM) yuffear: I'll let you finish your statements
(10:56:00 PM) yuffear: I'm just going to respond
(10:56:03 PM) yuffear: So talk
(10:56:08 PM) yuffear: Respond to what I just said
(10:56:13 PM) yuffear: About that day
(10:57:30 PM) FFCGolbez: right. it's between yo uand Yuffie. I won't be here
(10:57:32 PM) FFCGolbez left the room.
(10:57:33 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, I was being presented a badge that I did not truly deserve. I thought it was best to not accept it. I never made the website for rank, or badges.
(10:58:06 PM) yuffear: Hmm
(10:58:14 PM) yuffear: You say this, but why didn't you say that at the time
(10:58:14 PM) yuffear: ?
(10:58:20 PM) yuffear: Your story keeps changing
(10:58:22 PM) yuffear: Its hard to believe you
(10:58:31 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, you blew up on me.
(10:58:38 PM) yuffear: No I didn't
(10:58:41 PM) yuffear: Not at first
(10:58:49 PM) yuffear: It was after talking about it for a long time with you
(10:59:01 PM) yuffear: After I had presented you with something
(10:59:56 PM) yuffear: Your supposed to accept it, and if you were so nice to give us a website and that you didn't want anything from it (The badge didn't just represent that) but you didn't state it at the time
(11:01:18 PM) yuffear: ?
(11:01:25 PM) FF4Cecil: You know, I prepared a whole presentation of how the website would function, but I was never given the opportunity to present it among the leaders of the clan together to clear up any confusion or misconceptions about it.
(11:01:37 PM) yuffear: No one had any misconceptions
(11:01:42 PM) yuffear: We wanted to use
(11:01:43 PM) yuffear: the newspaper
(11:01:45 PM) yuffear: for news
(11:01:54 PM) yuffear: And we waned to use yours for sc league and stats
(11:01:57 PM) yuffear: I told you this
(11:02:05 PM) yuffear: And it doesn't need to be further dicussed
(11:02:12 PM) yuffear: This is what I'm talking about
(11:02:33 PM) yuffear: Your not supposed to argue with me about it
(11:02:55 PM) yuffear: You never had intentions to make it a full fledged site in the beginning
(11:03:35 PM) Unable to send message: The message is too large.
(11:03:40 PM) Unable to send message: The message is too large.
(11:03:47 PM) FF4Cecil: I don't have the resources to make an SC League for the clan, I made this clear to Butz a long time ago. Instead, I proposed a different system that rewards members with experience points
(11:03:53 PM) FF4Cecil: and character levels automatically. When I told Dan about it, he loved the idea. He based his Red Wings' experience point system off of
(11:04:00 PM) yuffear: Whatever
(11:04:02 PM) yuffear: Thats fine
(11:04:15 PM) FF4Cecil: When I started making this website, there was no Newspaper.
(11:04:23 PM) yuffear: Well
(11:04:25 PM) yuffear: Guess what
(11:04:33 PM) yuffear: Thats too bad
(11:04:39 PM) yuffear: Whatever I do
(11:04:48 PM) yuffear: Is above anything else, because I'm a co-leader
(11:05:04 PM) yuffear: your supposed to respect what I do, and what I say
(11:05:10 PM) yuffear: I'm not saying anything harsh to you
(11:05:15 PM) yuffear: We just didn't want official news
(11:05:19 PM) FF4Cecil: You're right. But nevertheless, I was upset that all the time I had spent working on it was really in vain.
(11:05:20 PM) yuffear: Its that simple
(11:05:28 PM) yuffear: Yeah
(11:05:38 PM) yuffear: You really fucked it up now cause we're not gunna use it at all
(11:05:59 PM) yuffear: We don't trust you anymore Cecil.
(11:06:04 PM) yuffear: With anything
(11:06:08 PM) yuffear: We demoted you as well
(11:06:18 PM) yuffear: That is, if you can somehow manage to pass my judgement
(11:06:33 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, you are setting me up for failure.
(11:06:40 PM) yuffear: I think I know what'd you would have to do, but I doubt someone of your character is going to do something about it.
(11:06:44 PM) yuffear: Nope
(11:06:46 PM) yuffear: We all spoke
(11:06:48 PM) yuffear: And agreed
(11:06:49 PM) yuffear: No website
(11:06:52 PM) yuffear: No avatars
(11:06:56 PM) yuffear: Demotion
(11:07:04 PM) yuffear: Cause you almost caused a split in the clan
(11:07:11 PM) yuffear: Thats serious shit
(11:07:21 PM) FF4Cecil: I don't really care at all about the demotion.
(11:07:38 PM) yuffear: Ok
(11:07:40 PM) yuffear: whatever
(11:07:42 PM) FF4Cecil: It was never my intention nor my idea to cause the clan to split.
(11:07:46 PM) yuffear: Well
(11:07:51 PM) yuffear: You almost did it
(11:08:01 PM) yuffear: What makes you think its okay just because you didn't mean to? You still did it
(11:08:08 PM) yuffear: You talked shit to many people
(11:08:09 PM) yuffear: About me
(11:08:15 PM) yuffear: And then you pissed golb off
(11:08:18 PM) yuffear: While the entire time
(11:08:20 PM) yuffear: You were ignoring me
(11:08:48 PM) yuffear: So
(11:08:55 PM) yuffear: That attitude will not be accepted
(11:09:20 PM) yuffear: You don't ever decide to ignore someone, especially if they are trying to make peace
(11:09:25 PM) yuffear: Who the hell do you think you are?
(11:09:28 PM) yuffear: This is my place Cecil
(11:09:40 PM) yuffear: How dare you disrespect me like that?
(11:09:41 PM) yuffear: If I'm on good terms
(11:09:43 PM) yuffear: Its bullshit
(11:10:49 PM) FF4Cecil: I really don't appreciate your condescending attitude towards me. Everything I've done was for the clan, not for my personal gain.
(11:11:00 PM) yuffear: Hey guess what Cecil
(11:11:03 PM) yuffear: We're not talking about you right now
(11:11:05 PM) yuffear: we're talking about me
(11:11:08 PM) yuffear: And what you did
(11:11:11 PM) yuffear: Why don't you respond to it
(11:11:14 PM) yuffear: Don't bring up yourself
(11:11:15 PM) yuffear: Seriously
(11:11:21 PM) FF4Cecil: I made avatars for everyone, I didn't single any one out. I never asked anybody to use the avatars I made, and I never forced them to either.
(11:11:29 PM) FF4Cecil: I even made you one.
(11:11:29 PM) yuffear: Yeah but guess what
(11:11:33 PM) yuffear: Yeah
(11:11:35 PM) yuffear: I don't care
(11:11:45 PM) yuffear: If I made avatars for people
(11:11:49 PM) yuffear: And you just decide to come along
(11:11:58 PM) yuffear: And make ones so people use yours and not mine
(11:12:02 PM) yuffear: It makes my work useless
(11:12:08 PM) yuffear: So I returned the favour
(11:12:29 PM) FF4Cecil: Why didn't you talk to me about it if that bothered you? I didn't know it bothered you.
(11:12:47 PM) yuffear: It bothered me on that account
(11:12:54 PM) yuffear: And that you just decided to make it "FFC Official"
(11:13:09 PM) yuffear: Regardless
(11:13:26 PM) yuffear: I haven't treated you like shit until you've had your stubburn moment with the badge and the website
(11:13:43 PM) yuffear: So there is some things your going to have to agree upon if you wanna come back
(11:14:05 PM) yuffear: 1. Don't make avatars unless people ask you, Cause I'm going to be making all of them
(11:14:17 PM) yuffear: 2. We're not going to use your website, because we don't trust you with such a responsibility
(11:14:42 PM) yuffear: 3. You've got to show respect to me on all levels, any violation will result in a exilation
(11:15:20 PM) yuffear: 4. You've got to apologize to everyone, and me for causing drama and bullshit and almost fucking the clan up for good.
(11:16:57 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, can I ask for your personal opinion?
(11:17:04 PM) yuffear: No
(11:17:10 PM) yuffear: You respond to what I just said
(11:17:21 PM) yuffear: You got my opinion, I'm not asking any questions about yourself
(11:17:26 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, if you answered this, it would really help me make my decision.
(11:17:33 PM) yuffear: What
(11:18:00 PM) FF4Cecil: Do you want me to be in your clan again?
(11:18:13 PM) yuffear: Not until you agree on all of those things and do what is required
(11:18:22 PM) yuffear: So right now, I could say a big fat NO
(11:18:28 PM) yuffear: Because your a asshole in my mind
(11:18:40 PM) yuffear: Because you have yet to do anything
(11:18:49 PM) yuffear: To compensate for what you did
(11:20:49 PM) FF4Cecil: Well, if I agreed to those terms, would you treat me with respect and have respectable conversations with me?
(11:23:37 PM) yuffear: Well
(11:23:54 PM) yuffear: You've done this all wrong
(11:24:01 PM) yuffear: I feel like the one who has to come to terms
(11:24:06 PM) yuffear: Thats not the case here
(11:24:08 PM) yuffear: Besides
(11:24:12 PM) yuffear: Butz viewed the log
(11:24:20 PM) yuffear: I don't even have a choice now
(11:24:28 PM) yuffear: His word is a final goodbye
(11:24:53 PM) yuffear left the room.
