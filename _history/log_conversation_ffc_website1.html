ATTENTION: Transfer complete: ffcwebpreview.jpg.
dafrigginstud: Um okay
dafrigginstud: That's fucking
dafrigginstud: Beastastic
dafrigginstud: I don't know if Yuffie will want to relinquish the reins to her site though
FF4Cecil: Golbez was pretty happy with it too. He told me about the pink site Frost made some time ago.
dafrigginstud: I have some concerns
dafrigginstud: Will you be the only administrator?
FF4Cecil: No, I want to set something up so you guys can post news.
dafrigginstud: Just news?
dafrigginstud: We're not too fond of restrictions
FF4Cecil: Well? What exactly do you want to have access to do?
dafrigginstud: You really don't trust us them
dafrigginstud: then*
FF4Cecil: No, that's not it.
dafrigginstud: Well?
FF4Cecil: Do you know html or php?
dafrigginstud: Some, not fully fluently
FF4Cecil: Well. What exactly do you want to have access to do?
dafrigginstud: My point is we don't want to be chained to asking you to change shit all the time for updates and such
dafrigginstud: If we'd like to add a page, that we could
dafrigginstud: And I know you like to argue things out
dafrigginstud: I really see problems coming up
dafrigginstud: What I thought you were doing was a site to host your program
dafrigginstud: To retrieve stats and all that
FF4Cecil: Well my program is hosted on it. When you click on the Members page, you'll see a detail character status of every member int he clan.
dafrigginstud: It all depends on what accomodations you can make for our use
dafrigginstud: Know what I mean?
FF4Cecil: What exactly do you guys want to do?
dafrigginstud: dafrigginstud: My point is we don't want to be chained to asking you to change shit all the time for updates and such
dafrigginstud: If we'd like to add a page, that we could
dafrigginstud: And I know you like to argue things out
FF4Cecil: Well what do you want to add? Because I already have plans for new sections that aren't on there yet.
dafrigginstud: ...
dafrigginstud: When things arise...
dafrigginstud: Like if I get an idea
dafrigginstud: And I want to add a page one day
FF4Cecil: Well, it should stick with the format and layout of the rest of the site.
dafrigginstud: Sigh
FF4Cecil: You don't seem too thrilled about this.
dafrigginstud: I'll use an analogy
dafrigginstud: You have a girlfriend
dafrigginstud: But a hotter chick walks by you and smiles at you
dafrigginstud: Now you have a dilemma
dafrigginstud: The one that is more attractive, or the one that isn't as good, but allows you more freedom
dafrigginstud: I don't know about you
dafrigginstud: But we're not going to kill ourselves for looks
dafrigginstud: I appreciate everything, I really do
dafrigginstud: But you also have to think about us
FF4Cecil: Maybe the issue here is you don't really trust me?
dafrigginstud: Not just making something huge and imposing it on us
dafrigginstud: No
dafrigginstud: I speak frank words
dafrigginstud: Furthermore
dafrigginstud: I don't want to have the clan choose between sites
FF4Cecil: I've discussed with you guys about making a website for the clan before, and after you discussed it with Yuffie/Kain, you guys said it was fine.
dafrigginstud: Uh yeah...
dafrigginstud: That was for the Sc patch
dafrigginstud: to play leagues
dafrigginstud: And so you could host your program thing
dafrigginstud: And we'd attach the link on the main site
dafrigginstud: I'm not saying no now
dafrigginstud: I'm saying we'll need accomodation
dafrigginstud: This will also imply not spending entire nights discussing the pros and cons about little things...
FF4Cecil: I have a phone call, brb.
dafrigginstud: Alright
FF4Cecil: Ok, back.
dafrigginstud: Welcome back
FF4Cecil: Thanks.
dafrigginstud: So where were we
FF4Cecil: You were saying how you want to add stuff yourself to this website.
dafrigginstud: Ah, yes
FF4Cecil: Was this ever an issue before?
dafrigginstud: Yes
dafrigginstud: The reason why Yuffie's site even exists was because we never had the freedom with Vince's site
FF4Cecil: I see. Well, I've done a lot of QA (Quality Assurance) work with the navy. Before anything is ever really called complete, we do inspections of what we worked on to ensure it's good. I'd like to apply that concept to the website as well, where it will be checked for grammar, program/design errors, and consistency in layout.
