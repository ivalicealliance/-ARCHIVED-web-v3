(11:15:56 AM) dafrigginstud: Hey, what's the status in your head?
(11:16:20 AM) FF4Cecil: What?
(11:16:26 AM) dafrigginstud: Sorry about being harsh before
(11:16:28 AM) dafrigginstud: But that's how it has to be
(11:16:52 AM) FF4Cecil: I disagree. It doesn't have to be that way.
(11:17:08 AM) dafrigginstud: Well this is how things work here
(11:17:18 AM) dafrigginstud: It's something you're going to have to accept
(11:17:50 AM) FF4Cecil: You want me to accept disrespect for no reason?
(11:18:04 AM) dafrigginstud: How have I disrespected you?
(11:18:20 AM) FF4Cecil: I've been banned from the channel for no reason.
(11:18:24 AM) dafrigginstud: She also said she was joking, lighten up?...take a joke?...
(11:18:40 AM) dafrigginstud: If I took a fit everytime I was fucking insulted
(11:18:44 AM) FF4Cecil: If someone says something, and then waits 40 seconds before they say "jk", it doesn't seem like a joke at all.
(11:18:47 AM) dafrigginstud: A LOT of people wouldn't be here
(11:19:01 AM) dafrigginstud: Uh
(11:19:03 AM) dafrigginstud: I talked to her
(11:19:03 AM) FF4Cecil: I didn't take a fit. I was banned.
(11:19:05 AM) dafrigginstud: She meant it as a joke
(11:19:10 AM) dafrigginstud: So get over it
(11:19:16 AM) FF4Cecil: I didn't ban anybody, I WAS the one banned.
(11:19:17 AM) dafrigginstud: She was doing other things
(11:19:33 AM) dafrigginstud: Yes
(11:19:46 AM) dafrigginstud: Cause you couldn't take a god damn joke and it really dug under her skin
(11:19:52 AM) dafrigginstud: Cause you're like a god damn robot
(11:20:03 AM) dafrigginstud: It was only temporary
(11:20:03 AM) FF4Cecil: I'm sure most people would disagree with that.
(11:20:21 AM) dafrigginstud: Well I think that way
(11:20:25 AM) dafrigginstud: And I would make the case
(11:20:30 AM) dafrigginstud: A case much stronger than yours
(11:20:51 AM) dafrigginstud: It's not because you might add a "lol" here and there that you're not a robot
