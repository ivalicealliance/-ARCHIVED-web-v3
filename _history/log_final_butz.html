(8:19:52 PM) dafrigginstud: I want you to accept that you're ignorance, and go about resolving that issue, but more importantly, for you to want to help yourself with it..
(8:19:56 PM) dafrigginstud: .*
(8:21:18 PM) FF4Cecil: Is that it?
(8:21:30 PM) dafrigginstud: Mostly
(8:21:41 PM) dafrigginstud: Do you actually care?
(8:22:15 PM) FF4Cecil: I am not going to be a given a second chance, right?
(8:22:25 PM) dafrigginstud: Answer the question first.
(8:23:02 PM) FF4Cecil: Yes I care.
(8:24:00 PM) dafrigginstud: Do you care enough to accept it as a fact or will you simply go with your life without reflecting?
(8:24:12 PM) dafrigginstud: go on*
(8:26:12 PM) FF4Cecil: I don't agree with your opinion of me. There isn't a fact, there is an opinion here.
(8:27:00 PM) dafrigginstud: Then you have cemented your fate. You cannot join the clan anew.
(8:30:14 PM) FF4Cecil: I assure you my website and character system will still see the light of day. I also assure you that I will give you a run for your money as being the dominant Final Fantasy Clan.
(8:30:40 PM) dafrigginstud: You're creating a new clan, huh.
(8:30:52 PM) dafrigginstud: Laughable.
(8:30:54 PM) dafrigginstud: Lamentable
(8:30:56 PM) dafrigginstud: Pitiful.
(8:31:12 PM) dafrigginstud: You will be a complete failure.
(8:31:42 PM) dafrigginstud: You think you're even close to rivaling our trio because you have a stupid site?
(8:32:42 PM) FF4Cecil: It's more than just the site I have.
(8:32:48 PM) dafrigginstud: Oh, really.
(8:32:55 PM) dafrigginstud: Look here, son.
(8:33:03 PM) dafrigginstud: You don't have the activity it takes to run a clan.
(8:33:10 PM) dafrigginstud: You don't have the open mind to run a clan.
(8:33:20 PM) dafrigginstud: You don't have the right values to run a clan.
(8:33:30 PM) dafrigginstud: You're not likable.
(8:33:38 PM) dafrigginstud: Exactly because everything has to be your way.
(8:33:48 PM) dafrigginstud: And if it's not, you start fucking crying about it.
(8:33:57 PM) dafrigginstud: You have no respect for hierarchy.
(8:34:15 PM) dafrigginstud: It's all about you thinking you're always in the right
(8:34:23 PM) FF4Cecil: My clan will not be run by fear, and people will not be treated with disrespect for no good reason.
(8:34:36 PM) dafrigginstud: This clan is not run by fear.
(8:34:51 PM) dafrigginstud: And I have good reason to disrespect you.
(8:35:01 PM) dafrigginstud: The entire clan now is against you and agrees with us.
(8:35:15 PM) dafrigginstud: Who do you think you are?
(8:35:19 PM) dafrigginstud: The master planner?
