<p>
  We have a long-standing open recruitment policy. If you are interested in joining,
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link agreement.html %}">please review the agreement</a> and follow these instructions. The only account you need to create is a Discord account
  if you do not already have one.

<h3>
  Choose a Final Fantasy Character
</h3>
<p>
  Our community has a Final Fantasy theme meaning you must choose a Final Fantasy Character as your persona. Any characters listed on
  the
  <a href="https://ffrkstrategy.gamematome.jp/game/951/wiki/Character">Final Fantasy Record Keeper wiki</a> are acceptable. We will also accept characters not on this list as long we can verify
  the character is from a Final Fantasy game. Spin-offs are included.
</p>
<p>
  If the character was previously used by a past member, it can be re-used. The character you chose must be inactive for at
  least 6 months. When re-using, the past member using the name will be
  <em>versioned</em> such that a numerical digit will be appended to their name for historical and archiving purposes.
  The new member (you) will not have a digit in your name.

  a previously inactive character.
