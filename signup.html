  Select a Final Fantasy Character

<p>
  You must choose a Final Fantasy Character as your persona. Any characters listed on the

  Characters not on this list are also acceptable when verified to be in any Final Fantasy game including spin-offs.

<p>
  Previously used characters can be re-used if the past member has been inactive for at least 6 months. When re-using, 
  the past member using the name will be <em>versioned</em> by adding a numerical digit, and will select a new character upon reactivation.
  The new member (you) will not have a digit in your name.
