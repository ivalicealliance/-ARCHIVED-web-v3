<p>
  As of right now, the Ivalice Alliance has an open recruitment policy. If you are interested in joining,
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link agreement.html %}">please review the agreement</a> and follow these instructions. The only account you need to create is a Discord account
  if you do not already have one.
</p>
<h3>
  Choose a Final Fantasy Character
</h3>
<p>
  The clan has a Final Fantasy theme meaning you must choose Final Fantasy Character as a persona. Any characters listed on
  the
  <a href="https://ffrkstrategy.gamematome.jp/game/951/wiki/Character">Final Fantasy Record Keeper wiki</a> are acceptable. We will also accept characters not on this list as long we can verify
  the character is from a Final Fantasy game. Spin-offs are included.
</p>
<p>
  If the character was previously used by a past member, it can be re-used. The character you chose must be inactive for at
  least 6 months. When re-using, the past member using the name will be
  <em>versioned</em>, meaning they will have a numerical digit appended to their name for historical and archiving purposes,
  while the new member (you) will not have a digit.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.html %}#leadership">Start a dialog with a Leader or Judge</a> for any clarification and help on trying to decide on a character or re-using
  a previously inactive character.
</p>
<h3>
