Welcome to the new Ivalice Alliance website! To commemorate the clan’s 10 year anniversary, we have completely rebuilt this site from the ground up. There are also several announcements to share today! 

### Technology
Technology has always been an important part of the clan experience and we're always experimenting with new ideas from bots and site generation to forums. To further emphasize the importance of technology in the clan, I’m happy to announce we will be open sourcing our projects starting with this site! If you see any issues, please report it or even try [fixing it yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/)! Ask in our #infrastructure channel on Discord if you would like help on how to start contributing. Everyone in the clan can safely make changes to the site and now post any news!

### Discord
So far, we've had a good experience using Discord over Skype. Since all the communications and discussions are now happening on there, we decided to deprecate the forums. We are betting big on Discord as a platform and will be using it for account management. Going forward, your discord account is the only account you need to be a member in the clan. We'll be exploring ways of integrating this with our new site beyond a link to the server.

### What's Next
We will continue making changes and improving this site. I'm still changing the layout, theming, and branding. The next big change I will be exploring is a new profile system. We are also planning a live event for the 10 year anniversary. It will take place sometime in February with more details in a separate post. Check back soon!
