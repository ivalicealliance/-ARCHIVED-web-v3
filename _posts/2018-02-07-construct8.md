![Meet Construct 8]({{ page.image | relative_url }}){: style="max-width: 650px; width: 100%;"}
{: .text-center}

I'm happy to announce we now have an [official Members page]({% link members.html %})! The Members list is updated live with our current membership from the Discord server. To keep uniformity, the sprites are sourced from [Final Fantasy Record Keeper](https://ffrkstrategy.gamematome.jp/game/951/wiki/Character). The character's originating game logo will be used for those missing sprites until a suitable replacement is found.

### Construct8
I created a new bot named after the character *Construct 8* from *Final Fantasy Tactics* that provides the Members list. [Keeping our promise]({% post_url 2018-01-16-web-relaunch %}), I have also open sourced the bot under the GPLv3 license. You can [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/construct8) and provide any feedback or improvements.
