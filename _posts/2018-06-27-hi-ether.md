It's been a while since the last update, so here's a quick note. I've created and open-sourced a new bot for Discord that will countdown the days for any specified product to its target release date. The bot is named **Hi-Ether** and uses a webhook to communicate with a Discord server. You can [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/Hi-Ether) and provide any feedback or improvements.

We are currently using it to countdown the days until [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/) is released! We are planning to do a launch event for the game and will provide more details at another time.
